Rules:
- 5 to 12 sub_aspects, mutually distinct (no overlapping or duplicate aspects).
- "vital" = the narrative explicitly asks about it or an answer omitting it
  would clearly be incomplete; "okay" = secondary/supporting aspect.
- Every explicitly named domain, decision, comparison, time period, or
  requested output structure in the narrative must appear in at least one
  sub_aspect and must be marked "vital".
- Do not merge explicitly named requirements when merging could hide whether
  each requirement is covered; prefer separate, specific sub_aspects.
- Titles must be specific to this narrative, not generic ("Economic impact of
  X on Y", not "Impacts").
- JSON only. No text before or after."""
